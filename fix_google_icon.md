# Fix Google Icon Issue

## Problem
Your `assets/Signinwith/google.png` file contains an Apple icon instead of a Google icon.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Download Official Google Icon (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://developers.google.com/identity/branding-guidelines
2. Scroll to "Download Pre-Approved Brand Icons" section
3. Click the download link to get official Google sign-in icons
4. Extract the ZIP file
5. Find the appropriate Google icon (light theme, standard size)
6. Replace your `assets/Signinwith/google.png` with the official Google icon

### Option 2: Use a Simple Google Icon
If you can't access the official download, you can:
1. Search for "Google G logo PNG transparent" on Google Images
2. Download a simple Google "G" icon
3. Make sure it's:
   - PNG format
   - Transparent background
   - Approximately 24x24 or 32x32 pixels
   - Google's official colors (blue, red, yellow, green)

### Option 3: Create Your Own
1. Open any image editor (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Create a 32x32 pixel image
3. Draw or add the Google "G" logo
4. Save as PNG with transparent background
5. Replace `assets/Signinwith/google.png`

## Quick Fix
The easiest fix is to:
1. Delete the current `assets/Signinwith/google.png` file
2. Download a proper Google icon from the official Google branding page
3. Rename it to `google.png` and place it in `assets/Signinwith/`
4. Run `flutter clean` and rebuild your app

## Verification
After replacing the file:
1. Run `flutter clean`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run your app
4. Check that the Google icon appears instead of Apple icon
