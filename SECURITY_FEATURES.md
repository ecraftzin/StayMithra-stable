## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access/modify their own data
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (RLS + client validation)
3. **Data Isolation**: Private chats are completely isolated
4. **Audit Trail**: All operations are logged with timestamps
5. **Secure Defaults**: All tables have RLS enabled by default
6. **Input Validation**: Proper validation in forms and API calls

## Testing Security

To verify security is working:

1. **Test User Isolation**: 
   - Create two users
   - Verify they can't access each other's private data
   - Verify they can see public posts/campaigns

2. **Test Chat Privacy**:
   - Create chat between User A and User B
   - Verify User C cannot see the chat or messages

3. **Test Post/Campaign Ownership**:
   - Verify users can only edit/delete their own content
   - Verify public content is visible to all

4. **Test Real-time Security**:
   - Verify real-time updates respect permissions
   - Verify private messages only go to participants

## Security Monitoring

The app includes proper error handling and logging to help identify:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Database constraint violations
- Real-time subscription errors

All security policies are enforced at the database level, making the app secure by default regardless of client-side code changes.
